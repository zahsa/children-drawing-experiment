# children-drawing-experiment

The experiments are done on twenty seven children ages three from an Iranian
kindergarten. They were assessed by asking to draw a sketch of an object. A prototypical
image of each object was also shown on computer monitor and remained for about 30
seconds to assure that children are aware of what they are asked to draw. When the image
is appeared on the screen, all children mention the name loudly and therefore it is made
sure that they all know the object in question. Therefore, the image on the screen only
helps children to retrieve the stored visual information about an object from their
memory. Moreover, it is explained to them that they have not to copy the images but
rather to draw what they know about the object. Hence, children are not biased with
images they have observed and the visual information is merely provided as a way to
trigger children’s mind about the questioned concept. All through the experiment, an
instructor checks on children one by one an in case a chilf could not draw anything, the
instructor talks to her and asks her question such as “how does the object look like?”, Or
“what the object is used for?” 
The stimuli set are selected in a way to contain both animate and inanimate objects but
the images are selected in a way to be easily recognizable for children.
